This week I updated the test results with the new algorithms. I am not sure if it currently is the way it should be as regards efficiency, but some changes were seen in the results. I also initially tried to make the UI a bit more fancy, but due to some lack of time decided to not keep those changes in the code as they were not working as fluently as I would have liked. Overall, some 10 hours were spent on the project this week.
