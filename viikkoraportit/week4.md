This week I decided to change the course of the project entirely, as I encountered that the fundamental algothimical comparison present in the previous version was not done according to the basic requirements of the course. Thus, I decided to move from maze solving to file compression comparison. I decided to compare the performance of Huffman and LZW agorithms in file compression. As the course instructions and the way this kind of projects are done was familiar to me due to the previous version of this course project I implemented, I was able to focus entirely to the core implementation of these algorithms on the code level.
