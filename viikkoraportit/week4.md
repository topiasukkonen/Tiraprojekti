This week I decided to change the course of the project entirely, as I encountered that the fundamental algothimical comparison present in the previous version was not done according to the basic requirements of the course. Thus, I decided to move from maze solving to file compression comparison. I decided to compare the performance of Huffman and LZW agorithms in file compression. As the course instructions and the way this kind of projects are done was familiar to me due to the previous version of this course project I implemented, I was able to focus entirely to the core implementation of these algorithms on the code level. Time spent to this whole change was about 30 hours this week. I implemented the algorithms as a code, put the text file that is used in the code to compression as its own independent .txt file to allow a bit more flexibility in the performance testing in different scenarios and did the basic command line functionality to the project, which enables the code to be run easily with relevant information also showing to the user as printed values (immutability of the file and compression results as percentages compared to the original uncompressed file). Also, added some basic test cases that are ran at the same time as the core program itself, which allows user to easily see if any errors have occured.
