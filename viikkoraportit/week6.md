This week I did quite a few changes to my project. I added more comprehensive unit tests and improved other testing also. Now the project uses either direct binary files or text files that are then converted to binary as its input. I refactored the project quite a bit, mostly regarding the documentation. I also added the poetry stuff to the project repo on Github. I added running times to each algorithm that can now be seen by the user after running the code. All this took something of 25 hours of work.
