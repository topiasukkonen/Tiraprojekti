For this week, I have worked to finalise the project. I have made comprehensive changes on the compression to improve the efficiency of the LZW, and now it runs even larger sized compressions in a time that is not too long. On Huffman, I have changed the functionality so it saves the necessary information of the Huffman compression on the same compressed file instead of making it a separate one. Tests and documentation have been updated and simplified. Overall, spent about 20 hours this week.
