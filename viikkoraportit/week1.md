These two weeks I have continued this project of mine that got left unfinnished during the beginning of the summer. I have updated the algorithm that was previously seen as inefficient. Now, it might be the way it should be. I still have to udate the results on ReadMe. During this week, I am aiming at getting the test results on the algo efficiency done and updated. Overall workload during these two weeks has so far been approximately 15 hours.
