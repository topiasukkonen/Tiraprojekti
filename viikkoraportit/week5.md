This week I did not have that much time to develop this project. Mostly, I was planning on how to make certain changes in the future weeks to this project. The peer review that was given to me gave me some insights into how I could make the project better. For instance, it would be beneficial to refactor the code into separate files where each file would represent some coherent part of the project. I will maybe also add some more tests, but let's see. Overall, this week used about 5 hours on planning possible future changes to this project.
