# Specification Document

- **Programming language:** Python
- **Other known languages:** JavaScript
- **Implemented algorithms and data structures:** Huffman Encoding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Encoding, heaps, dictionaries, and lists. These algorithms were chosen as they provide effective and efficient means of compressing and decompressing data.
- **Problem being solved:** The project tackles the problem of data compression. It does so by implementing Huffman and LZW encoding and decoding algorithms.
- **Inputs:** The program should be able to handle multiple file formats as it does compression using binary format.
- **Target time and space complexity:** Time and space complexity should be O(n) for both algorithms.
- **Degree programme:** Bachelorâ€™s in Science (BSc), Computer Science
- **Documentation language:** English
