# Specification Document

- **Programming language:** Python
- **Other known languages:** Java, JavaScript
- **Implemented algorithms and data structures:** Huffman Encoding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Encoding, Heaps, Dictionaries. These algorithms were chosen as they provide effective and efficient means of compressing and decompressing data.
- **Problem being solved:** The project tackles the problem of data compression, with a focus on text data. It does so by implementing Huffman and LZW encoding and decoding algorithms.
- **Inputs:** The program accepts a binary file as an input.
- **Target time and space complexity:** The target time complexity for the encoding and decoding processes implemented in this project is linear, i.e., O(n), where n is the size of the input data. The space complexity is also linear in the worst-case scenario, which can occur when the input data has a large number of unique characters.
- **Degree programme:** Bachelorâ€™s in Science (BSc)
- **Documentation language:** English
